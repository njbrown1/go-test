# Solving the first 50 Project Euler problems in 50 days

## Introduction

In an attempt to learn GOlang, I started solving problems on the site projecteuler.net. The problems require knowledge of both mathematics and coding, and while I've had past experience in competition mathematics (eg. AMC and Mathcounts), I've had practically no experience in coding. I did a four-week Python course in middle school, and I know the **very** basics of indexing, logic, functions, variables, and loops. So I wanted to do some of the problems from Project Euler to improve my coding skills!

## Typical Problems

Typical problems from Project Euler cover prime numbers (especially prime summations), Pythagorean triplets, squares and multiples.
